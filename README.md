Outcome: First Prize

Baymax is a mobile robot that was made in 5 hours (4 hours and 37 minutes to be precise). It went on to win ROSCore, a national level competition which involved designing the robot with capabilities of navigating, localising and planning its way through a maze while also parallely performing vision based tasks (scanning AR codes and storing them as reference points).
